# 07 - Machine Learning for Robotics 🧠

## Introduction
The integration of Machine Learning (ML) has revolutionized robotics, enabling systems to learn from data, adapt to new situations, and perform tasks that were previously impossible for traditionally programmed robots. This chapter provides a foundational understanding of various ML paradigms and how they are applied in robotics to enhance perception, decision-making, and control. We'll explore supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning in the context of physical AI.

## Key Concepts
*   **Overview of Machine Learning Paradigms:**
    *   **Supervised Learning:** Regression and Classification for robotic tasks (e.g., object recognition, sensor data interpretation).
    *   **Unsupervised Learning:** Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction for pattern discovery in sensor data.
*   **Feature Engineering:** Extracting meaningful information from raw sensor data for ML models.
*   **Learning from Demonstration (LfD):** Teaching robots new skills by observing human actions.
*   **Predictive Control with ML:** Using models to forecast system behavior and optimize control actions.
*   **Data Collection and Annotation for Robotic ML:** Challenges and best practices.
*   **Introduction to Model Deployment:** How to integrate trained ML models onto robotic platforms.
*   **Ethical Considerations in Robotic ML:** Bias, safety, and accountability in learned behaviors.

## Learning Objectives

## Exercises (Optional)
1.  Imagine a robot tasked with sorting different colored blocks. Describe how you would use a supervised learning approach for this task, including what data you would need and what kind of model you might train.
2.  Explain how unsupervised learning could be used by a robot to discover different types of objects in an unknown environment without prior labels.
3.  Research a real-world application where a robot has learned a complex task through demonstration. Briefly describe the task and the ML approach used.
