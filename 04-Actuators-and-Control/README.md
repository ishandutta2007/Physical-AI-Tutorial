# 04 - Actuators and Control 🦾

## Introduction
While sensors allow robots to perceive their environment, actuators are what enable them to act upon it. This chapter focuses on the "muscles" and "brains" of a robot – the mechanisms that generate motion and the control strategies that direct them. We'll explore various types of actuators, how they convert energy into movement, and delve deeper into control systems that ensure precise and stable robotic behavior, laying the groundwork for complex physical interactions.

## Key Concepts
*   **Types of Actuators:**
    *   **Electric Motors:** DC motors, stepper motors, servo motors.
    *   **Hydraulic and Pneumatic Actuators:** Principles and applications.
    *   **Novel Actuators:** Brief mention of soft robotics and other emerging types.
*   **Motor Control:**
    *   **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM):** Controlling motor speed and direction.
    *   **Gearboxes and Transmissions:** Modifying torque and speed.
*   **Feedback Control Systems:**
    *   **PID Controllers (Proportional-Integral-Derivative):** Detailed explanation of components, tuning, and application in robotics.
    *   **State-Space Control:** Introduction to more advanced control formulations.
*   **Trajectory Generation:** Planning smooth paths and movements for robot actuators.
*   **Actuator Selection:** Factors to consider when choosing actuators for specific robotic tasks (e.g., power, precision, size).

## Exercises (Optional)
1.  Compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of electric, hydraulic, and pneumatic actuators for a humanoid robot leg.
2.  Design a simple PID controller to control the angular position of a servo motor. Explain how you would tune the P, I, and D gains and what effect each gain has.
3.  Research a real-world robotic application (e.g., a robotic arm for surgery). Identify the types of actuators used and explain why those specific actuators were chosen for the task.
