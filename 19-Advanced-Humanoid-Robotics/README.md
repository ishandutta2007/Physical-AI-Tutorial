# 19 - Advanced Humanoid Robotics 🦾🧑‍🤝‍🧑

## Introduction
This chapter brings together all the previous concepts to delve into the cutting-edge of humanoid robotics. We will explore the integrated challenges of designing, controlling, and programming robots that closely mimic human form and function. From whole-body control that coordinates complex movements across many degrees of freedom to advanced perception and human-aware navigation, this chapter aims to provide insight into the research frontiers and current capabilities of highly advanced bipedal and dexterous robots.

## Key Concepts
*   **Whole-Body Control (WBC):** Coordinating multiple limbs and the torso for complex tasks.
    *   Prioritized tasks (e.g., balance, manipulation, obstacle avoidance).
    *   Optimization-based control.
*   **Human-Aware Navigation:** Humanoid robots navigating in crowded human environments.
    *   Predicting human motion, social navigation, proxemics.
*   **Multi-Contact Planning:** Generating motions that involve contacts with the environment beyond just the feet.
    *   Wall pushes, ladder climbing, manipulating large objects.
*   **Dexterous Manipulation with Humanoid Hands:**
    *   Advanced grasp planning and in-hand manipulation.
    *   Tool use.
*   **Humanoid Locomotion on Challenging Terrains:**
    *   Adapting gait to uneven, slippery, or deformable surfaces.
    *   Stair climbing, stepping over obstacles.
*   **Hardware Design of Advanced Humanoids:**
    *   Lightweight and powerful actuators.
    *   Advanced sensing for proprioception and exteroception.
    *   Energy efficiency and battery management.
*   **Learning for Complex Humanoid Behaviors:**
    *   End-to-end learning from perception to action.
    *   Meta-learning and lifelong learning for humanoids.
*   **Teleoperation and Shared Autonomy:** Human control with robotic assistance for complex tasks.
